My discovery of the AI code editor [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) was nothing short of a revelation, given its remarkable capabilities. 
Inspired, I decided to challenge it with the creation of a simple game: 2048.

The outcome was unexpectedly impressive. 
Despite my limited knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I managed to craft this game. 
Experience it for yourself below.

    <iframe src="/en/projects/game-2048/index.html" style="width: 600px; height: 600px; border: 0;"></iframe>
</div>

Just a heads-up, the game includes a few minor and random bugs. Interestingly, these quirks add a layer of unpredictability and fun to the gameplay!
